Purpose
-------

First and foremost, slack-term is a personal project. With this project I
never set out to create a "better" slack version than the official slack
client. And as such, my intention for the project is not to create a feature
complete alternative to the official slack client. It's cool that people 
want to use slack-term as an alternative, but I started this project because
I wanted to be able to send and receive slack messages from the terminal to
slack.

Issues
------

When posting issues please mention the following:

* Which version of slack-term you're using
* Method of installation (binary, go, or make)

Feature requests
----------------

When creating an issue that is a feature request, I will label it as such,
however this doesn't mean that it is an approved feature request. I will
leave it open for discussion and decide whether it is feasible and/or
desirable.

Pull requests
-------------

Before creating a solution, please create an issue that is open for discussion
first. This is to avoid dissappointment, for all the work you might have
done, that might not get merged or needs to be refactored.
